- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EternalKing04
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning cloud technologies and networking in my pursuit of becoming a system architect.
- ðŸŒ± Might start learning the basics of networking and SQL.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You will never reach me, mwa ha ha.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am an extreme fan of Pokemon and Kuroko no Basket.


I very much enjoy digital technologies and love the stage of tech when your planning what to buy which is why I want to become a systems architect so
I can plan and implement technology for a living (I think, correct me if I am wrong)

I'm not really a guy that does projects in his free time rather just play Pokemon, but if I do something and I remember this account exists I might put 
it on here, though don't expect it to be top tier alright
